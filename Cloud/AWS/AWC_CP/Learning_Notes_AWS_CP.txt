### Learning Notes for AWS CP

# AWS Global Infrastructure

- Amazon CloudFront 
- is a content delivery network operated by Amazon Web Services
  https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/

- Edge Locations 
- Used as nodes of a global content delivery network (CDN)
- Utilized by Amazon CloudFront and Amazon Route 53 

# Cloud Economics

- User interface for exploring your AWS costs
  https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/

# Compute Services

- Amazon EC2
- Provides secure and resizable virtuals servers on AWS
- Root Device type:
  Instance Store: Ephemeral storage that is physically attached to the host the virtual server is running on
  Elastic Block Store (EBS): Persistent storage that exists separately from the host the virtual server is running on  

# Amazon EC2 Purchase Types

- EC2 Reserved Instance Types
  Standard - Highest discount, works for steady workloads
  Convertible - Enables the conversion of attributes, works for steady workloads
  Scheduled - Works for a time window you reserve, good for a predictable workload

- Savings Plans
  Similar in concept to reserved instances
  Supports compute with EC2, Fargate, and Lambda
  Unlike Reserved Instances, it does not reserve capacity
  Comes in 1 or 3 year terms

- Spot Instances
  Enable you to leverage excess EC2 compute capacity
  When you request instances, if your bid is higher than Spot price they will launch
  If the Spot price grows to exceeed your bid, the instances will be terminated
  Spot instances can be notified 2 minutes prior to termination

- Dedicated Host
  The dedicated host pricing model gives you a dedicated physical server.

# AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Platform for scaling and deploying web apps and services
- Platform as a Service offering
- Only pay for the other services you leverage
- Handles provisioning, load balancing, scaling and monitoring

# AWS Lambda
- Enables compute without managing servers
- Only charged for usage based on execution time
- Integrates with many AWS services
- Enables event-driven workflows

# Content and Network Delivery

- VPC - Amazon Virtual Private Cloud
- A logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define

- AWS Direct Connect
- A cloud service solution that makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your data center to AWS

- Elastic Load Balancing
- Distributes traffic across multiple targets
- Integrates with EC2, ECS (Elastic Container Service), and Lambda
- Supports one or more AZ's in a region
- Three types of load balancers
  Application Load Balancer ALB
  Network Load Balancer NLB
  Classic Load Balancer

- Scaling on Amazon EC2
  Vertical Scaling - You "scale up" your instance type to a larger instance type with additional resources
  Horizontal Scaling - You "scale out" and add additional instances to handle the demand of your application

- Amazon API Gateway
- Fully managed API management service
- Directly integrates with multiple AWS services
- Supports VPC and on-premises private applications

- AWS Global Accelerator
- Utilizes IP addresses that route to edge locations
- Once request reaches edge locations, traffic is routed through AWS network
- Can route request to many AWS resources:
  Network Load Balancer (NLB)
  Application Load Balancer (ALB)
  EC2 Instance
- AWS Global Accelerator Use Cases
  Non-HTTP Protocol - If you are using UDP, MQTT, or VOIP for your solution
  Requires Static IP - If your solution needs IP (and not DNS) reolution
  Instant Failover - If you need the best approach for failover and fault-tolerance
