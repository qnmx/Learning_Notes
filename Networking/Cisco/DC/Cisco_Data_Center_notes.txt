# Nexus Switches Overview
- Core Switches: Nexus 9000 & 7000/7700
- Aggregation Switches: Nexus 6000 & 5500/5600
- Access Switches: Nexues 5500/5600, 3000, 2000

Nexus Switch is made of 5 major parts:
- Chassis, a physical enclosure of the switch
- Supervisor, CPU of the switch
- Line Cards, physical ports that are plugged in to the network. Known as I/O Modules
- Power Supply Unit
- Fans

Nexus 7000/7700
- Core LAN & FCoE Switch
- Layer 2 & Layer 3 LAN Switching
- FCoE SAN Switching
- No Native FC Ports. FC - Fibre Channel

Nexus 5500/5600
- Aggregation & Access LAN & SAN Switch
- Layer 2 & Layer 3 LAN Switching
- FCoE & Natuve FC SAN Switching

Nexus 2000
- Acts like a remote line card of "parent" switch
  Parent is N7K, N6K, or N5K
- No local switching
  Traffic is switched/routed by parent

# MDS Switches Overview
- Cisco SAN Switches
- Core Switches: MDS 9700/9500
- Edge Switches: MDS 9200/9100

# MDS vs. Nexus
- Similarities
  Both run NX-OS
  Both suppoer SAN switching (N7K only FCoE, not FC)
- Differences
  MDS is not a LAN switch
  MDS has more SAN specific features
  - Higher port density
  - 16Gbps Native FC
  - SAN Extension (FCIP) - Fibre Channel over IP


# Transceivers

1G Transceivers
- Copper SFP
- Fiber GBIC
- Fiber SFP (mini GBIC)

10G Transceivers
- Fiber XENPAK
- Fiber SFP+, switch to switch connectivity
- Twinax (DAC), short distances, from TOR switch to the server within the same rack

40G Transceivers
- 40G QSFP to 4x 10G SFP+ Twinax
- QSFP+

100G Transceivers
-CFP-100G-ER4
- CPAK 100GBASE
