### NAT Terminology

Inside zone - networks that translator wants to hide

Inside local - Inside IPs before translation
Inside global - Inside IPs after translation

Outside zone - networks that are external to translator

Outside global 
- Original outside IP address
Outside local 
- Outside IP after translation as is seen inside

### NAT Order of Operations

On the inside
- Packets are first routed and then have sources translated
- Destination addresses are global so this is OK
One the outside
- Packets have destinations un-translated first
- Routing occurs after translation
- Allows proper routing for returning packets with translated sources
