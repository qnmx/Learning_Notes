# OSPF Cost

How to identify the OSPF Cost

OSPF cost is based on interface speed
Use the command:show ip ospf interfaceshow ip ospf interface brief

Calculating the OSPF Metric

Formula to calculate OSPF metric100,000,000 / [interface speed]

How to change the reference bandwidth

In order to adjust the reference bandwidth(100 Mbits is a default, check the documentation for any changes):auto-cost reference-bandwidth [value]
You can change the cost by:Using the “bandwidth" command under interface configuration mode (NOT recommended)
Use the command “ip ospf” cost [value]

1 Gbps = 1000 Mbps = 1 000 000 Kbps = 1 000 000 000 bps

1 Tbps = 1000 Gbps

# DR/BDR

DR/BDR communications224.0.0.5 - All SPF Routers224.0.0.6 - All DR/BDR Routers

How is DR/BDR determined

Election order of operations:Router with the highest interface priority (0-255)- 0 = Never participate in DR/BDR election- 255 = Always select as the DR
Router with the highest router-id value
Default priority values- 0 = Serial/Point-to-point interfaces- 1 = Ethernet interfaces

# OSPFv2 Authentication

Different Types of OSPF Authentication

Null - none
Simple password authentication - Plaintext authentication
MD5 Authentication- Most secure and best practice recommendation- a.k.a “hash”

Different Ways to Implement Authentication

GloballyFor all interfaces running OSPFSingle global OSPF configuration commandSingle interface configuration command
Per interfaceTwo interface configuration commands
Interface configuration overrides global configuration

Global OSPF settings: conf trouter ospf 1area 0 authentication message-digest (MD5)

Interface settings:interface gi 0/0ip ospf message-digest-key <Key ID> md5 <password> 

<Key ID> and password needs to match on both sides of the interface

====================CCNP Notes====================

# OSPF Neighbour Discovery on LAN

OSPF has two neighbourship classes:- Neighbours - stopped at the 2WAY state- Fully adjacent neighbours - reached the FULL state
OSPF uses an underlying finite state machine (FSM) with eight neighbour states that describe the current state of each OSPF neighbour
In hello message/packet, the following parameters must match:- Hello interval- Dead interval- Area ID- subnet mask- Stub area flag- Authentication
On a LAN, the default value of the hello interval is 10 seconds, and the dead interval is 40 seconds.
If the hello interval on a certain interface is changed, the dead interval is automatically changed (4x hello interval).
To change hello and dead intervals on an interface, use following commands:- ip ospf hello-interval <value>- ip ospf dead-interval <value>
With OSPF, if a neighbour is down it can be discovered in a second; that is, the hello interval can be changed to subsecond value and the dead interval can be made 1 second- ip ospf dead-interval minimal hello-multiplier <value>

# OSPF MTU Issue

The value of MTU should be the same on the devices attached to the same data link
If there is an MTU mismatch between the two routers who are trying to become OSPF neighbours, they will not able to exchange topology information.
The neighbours will get to the EXSTART state and then go down.

# OSPF Authentication

Unlike EIGRP, OSPF has different types of authentication
Configuring authentication is two-step process:1. Authentication must be enabled, and authentication type must be selected2. The authentication key must be configured
OSPF also supports the use of multiple keys on the same interface, but it does not support key chain
These keys cannot be configured as time based
To configure authentication type for the area-wide setting, use the following commands:area # authentication (type 1)area # authentication message-digest (type 2)
To configure authentication type using the interface subcommands, use following commands:ip ospf authentication null (type 0)ip ospf authentication (type 1)ip ospf authentication message-digest (type 2)
To configure the key on the interface level, use the following commands:ip ospf authentication-key key-value (Type 1)ip ospf message-digest-key key-number md5 key-value (Type 2)

# OSPF Network Types

On the LAN interface, neighbours are discovered dynamically using multicast (224.0.0.5)
LAN interfaces requires a DR because of the default OSPF network type of Broadcast
The network type setting can be changed using the following commandip ospf network <type> (interface-level command)

DISCOVERY: When one router's interface is set to a default network type (Broadcast) and second router's interface is set to a network type point-to-point, the neighbourship will be established and the routes will exchange the LSDBs. However the ping to the networks in the database will fail. Router with interface set to point-to-point network type, will display two types of network to the destination router.

# Types of LSAs

Type 1 - Router LSA
Type 2 - Network LSA - Generated by the DR / BDR
Type 3 - Network Summary LSA - Generated by the ABR
Type 4 - ASBR Summary LSA - Generated by the ABR
Type 5 - AS External LSA - Generated by the ASBR
Type 7 - NSSA External LSA - Generated by the ASBR

# OSPF Type 1 Router LSA

Each router creates a Type 1 LSA for itself and floods it throughout the same OSPF area
This LSA identifies an OSPF router based on its OSPF router-id
OSPF identifies a Type 1 LSA using a 32-bit link-state identifier (LSID)
Each router uses its own OSPF router-id as the LSID

# OSPF Type 2 LSA

OSPF Type 2 LSA is also known as Network LSA
Type 2 LSA is generated for multi-access networks
Generation of Type 2 LSA depends on the existence of a DR

Routers use the following election rules to elect a DR:

Choose a router with the highest priority value (default is 2 and max is 255)
If priority is tied, choose the router with highest RID
Choose a BDR, based on next-best priority, or if a tie, next-best highest RID.

# OSPF Type 2 LSA cont.

The DR's interface IP address is used as the LSID for type 2 LSA
Type 2 LSA also lists the RIDs of the OSPF neighbours connected/attached to that multi-access network

# OSPF Type 3 LSA

ABRs generate a Type 3 LSA for each subnet in an area, and advertise each Type 3 LSA into the other area
Type 3 LSA does not contain all the detailed topology information
Type 3 LSA, created by ABR, consists of each subnet and a cost to reach that subnet from that ABR
It summarises the information from Type 1 & Type 2 LSAs
The ABR assigns an LSID of the subnet number being advertised
The ABR also adds its own RID in the LSA, because multiple ASRs can advertise the same subnet with the same LSID

# Limiting the Number of LSAs

To limit the number of LSAs, use the following commandmax-lsa number (OSPF subcommand)  <------- Not a good Design Principal

# OSPF Databse Exchange Process

Every router within an area should have an identical copy of the LSDB

# OSPF Message Types

There are five types of OSPF messages- Hello- Database Description (DD or DBD)- Link-State Request- Link-State Update- Link-State Acknowledgement

# OSPF Neighbour States

OSPF has eight neighbour states:

Down - OSPF is turned on on the links, however there is no adjeceny between the routers
Attempt - this state is visible if router is statically defined by the neighbor command, one side is sending unicast hello messages
Init - when router receives the Hello and it does not hold value for its own Router ID, routers are also verifying the parameters in the hello message
2Way - routers at each end of a link know about each other and they can start exchanging other information
ExStart - Master and Slave negotiations, Master increments the sequence number of the DBD
Exchhange - Database Description is being sent at this stage
Loading - All DBDs are received, routers are sending LSR, LSU and LSA (Link-State Acknowledgement)
Full

# Periodic Flooding

OSPF re-floods each LSA every 30 minutes based on each LSA's age variable
When the router needs to flush an LSA from LSDB, it sets the age of the LSA to the MaxAge setting (3600 seconds - 1 hour) and re-floods the LSA

# OSPF Metric Calculation Overview

To calculate the best route, the logic is as follows:

Analyse the LSDB to find all possible routes to reach the subnet
For each possible route, add the OSPF interface cost for all outgoing interfaces in that route
Pick the route with the lowest total cost

# OSPF Hierarchy

Intra-area routes are always preferred over inter-area routers

# OSPF Route Filtering between Areas

The routers inside an area should have the same LSAs in their LSDB
If all routers inside an area do not have the same LSDB, SPF logic will fail
OSPF can filter the origination of an LSA between areas
Type 3 LSAa are filtered at ABRs; Type 5 LSAs are filtered at ASBR

# Type 3 LSA Filtering

Type 3 LSAs are filtered prior to origination on ABRs
If there are multiple ABRs connected in two areas, filtering should be done on both, ideally, unless some path manipulation is being done
To configure Type 3 filtering on ABRs, use the following command:area # filter-list prefix name(prefix-list) in | out (OSPF subcommand)Prefix list: allow all other networks as a next sequence in the prefix-list
When in is configured, IOS filters prefixes being created and flooded into the configured area
When out is configured, IOS filters prefixes coming out of the configured area
The prefixes being filtered will be denied in the prefix-list that will be created explicitly

# OSPF Route Filtering into the Routing Table

If within an area some routers, but not all, should not be learning a prefix/route, filtering between areas cannot be used
This can be accomplished by filtering routes between the OSPF database and the routing table
Routers will still have all the LSAs for all the routes
After running SPF, these routes are filtered using distribute-list before getting entered into the routing table
This type of filtering can be done on any OSPF router, not just ABR or ASBR
The command to configure distribute list filtering is:distribute-list prefix name(prefix-list) in | out <interface> (OSPF subcommand)
Only the “in” direction will work for this purpose
The interface can also be specified with this command; it will be the outgoing interface for the routes being matched in the prefix-list. This is an optional item.

# OSPF Route Summarization Overview

OSPF allows summarization at ABRs and ASBRs only
Summarization is done for LSAs, not routes
Summarization can also be used for path manipulation
To configure summarization on ABR, use the following command:area area-id range ip-address mask [ cost # ] (OSPF subcommand)
The configured area number refers to the area where the subnets exist; the summary will be advertised into all other areas connected to the ABR
There should be at least one subordinate subnet inside the range of the summary route
The area range command can also explicitly set the cost of the summary

# OSPF Route Summarization at ASBR

ASBRs create a Type 5 External LSA for each redistributed subnet
They list the subnet number as the LSID and the mask as one of the fields in the LSA
To configure summarization at ASBR, use the following command:summary-address prefix mask (OSPF subcommand)

# OSPF Default Route

There are several ways to introduce a default route into OSPF, either within only an area or the entire OSPF domain
A default route can be introduced using the area range or summary-address commands (old commands)
Tow other methods to introduce a default route in OSPF domain or area are:- Using the default-information originate command- Using stub areas

# Default Information Originate

With all default parameters, this command injects a default route into OSPF, as an external Type 2 route, using a Type 5 LSA with metric 1, but only if a default route exists in that router's routing table
With the always parameter, the default route is advertised even if there is no default route in the router's routing table
The metric keyword defines the metric listed for the default route (default 1)
The metric-type keyword defines whether the LSA is listed as external Type 1 or external Type 2(default)

# OSPF Stub Areas

There are several features of stub areas:

ABRs create a default route, using Type 3 LSA, and flood that into the stub area
ABRs do not flood Type 5 LSAs into the stub area
ABRs may not flood other Type 3 LSAs into the area
The default route has a metric of 1 unless otherwise configured using the OSPF subcommand area # default-cost cost
Routers inside stub areas cannot redistribute external routes into the stubby area, because that would require a Type 5 LSA in the area
All routers in the area must be configured to be stubby; if they are not, neighbour relationships cannot form between potential neighbours based on this mismatched configuration

# Difference in types of Stubby Areas

For all types of stubby areas, the ABR always fitters Type 5 (external) LSAs
For totally stubby and totally NSSA areas, the ABR also filters Type 3 LSAs

# Configuring Stub and Totally Stubby Areas

To configure an area as a stub area, use the following command:area # stub (OSPF subcommand)
The metric for the default route injected by ABRs can also be changed from the default metric of 1, using the command:area # default-metric metric
To configure an area as totally stubby, use the following command:area # stub no-summary (OSPF subcommand)
This command introduces the keyword “no-summary” which is only required on ABRs
If internal routers also use it, it will not cause problems

# OSPF Not-So-Stubby Areas (NSSA)

External routes cannot be injected to stub and totally stubby areas; this means that routers within these areas cannot do redistribution
Not-so-stubby areas prevents this problem by introducing a new type of LSA: Type 7
Routers within NSSA areas can redistribute routes as Type 7 LSA
Type 5 LSAs are still not allowed
Within NSSA Type 3, LSAs are still advertised
ABRs do not advertise, by default, a default-route into NSSA areasarea # nssa [default-information-originate] (OSPF subcommand on ABR)Default route with default-information-originate will be advertised as Type 7 LSA
To configure an area as totally NSSA, use the following commandarea # nssa no-summary (OSPF subcommand)When configured as Totally NSSA, ABR will advertise default route as Type 3 LSA

# Virtual Links

An OSPF virtual link allows two ABRs that connect to the same non-backbone area to form a neighbour relationship through that non-backbone area, even when separated by many other routers and subnets.
This virtual link acts like a virtual point-to-point connection between the two routers.
The two routers send the usual OSPF messages types, encapsulated inside unicast IP packets. Multicast is not used over this virtual link.
The non-backbone area, transit area, connecting ABRs to form the virtual link MUST NOT be a stub area

To configure a virtual link between ABRs, use the following command:area # virtual-link remote-RID (OSPF subcommand)

The area-number # in the above command refers to the transit area number
Changing the hello and/or dead interval for virtual links cannot be done at the interface level; it can be changed using the same area virtual-link command
To verify OSPF virtual link, use the command show ip ospf virtual-links

# OSPF Network Types

OSPF supports the following network types:- Broadcast- Non-broadcast- Point-to-point- Point-to-multipoint- Point-to-multipoint non-broadcast- Loopback

# Network Type Broadcast

The network type broadcast is the default on LAN interfaces
This network type discovers neighbours dynamically
This network type supports the use of DR/BDR

# Network Type Non-Broadcast

The network type non-broadcast is the default on Frame Relay physical or multipoint interfaces
This network type does NOT discovers neighbours dynamincally
Intervals: 30 & 120
Neighbours must be statically configured
This network type supports the use of the DR/BDR

# Network Type Point-to-Point

The network type point-to-point is the default on any point-to-point interface
This network type does not elect DR/BDR
This network type discovers neighbours dynamically
Intervals: 10 & 40

# Network Type Point-to-Multipoint

The network type point-to-multipoint is not the default on any kind of interface
This network type does not elect DR/BDR
This network type discovers neighbours dynamically
Intervals: 30 & 120

# Network Type Point-to-Multipoint Non-Broadcast

The network point-to-multipoint non-broadcast is similar to point-to-multipoint
As the name implies, neighbours will not be discovered dynamically

# How to Remember it all

If the network types starts with “point” it doesn't use a DR/BDR
If the network type has “non-broadcast” in the title it doesn't do dynamic neighbour discovery
Only Broadcast & Point-to-Point use faster timersHello - 10, Dead - 40
