### VRF - Virtual Routing and Forwarding

VRF is a L3 traffic isolation technology
VRFs create “virtual routers”
- VRF defines a new instance of the routing table
- Interfaces assigned to the VRF belong to that routing table
- Interfaces not in a VRF are in the “global” or “default” VRF

# VRF-Lite: Initial Configuration

Create VRF globally and apply descriptive name:
- Router(config)#ip vrf Company-A
Apply VRF to selected interfaces
- ip vrf forwarding Company-A(command removes any IP settings that were previously configured on the interface)

# VRF Verification Commands

show ip vrf <name>
show ip vrf interfaces <name>
show ip route vrf <name>
show ip protocols vrf <name>

# EIGRP VRF Configuration

router eigrp AS
address-family ipv4 vrf <name> autonomous-system AS (This AS is different than global AS; can be a random AS number)
network X.X.X.X X.X.X.X

OSPF VRF Configuration

each OSPF process must have a unique Process-ID (whether a VRF or Global process)
router ospf 1 vrf <name_1>
network x.x.x.x x.x.x.x area x
capability vrf-lite

router ospf 2 vrf <name_2>
network x.x.x.x x.x.x.x area x
capability vrf-lite

Same “show” commands for OSPF verification apply whether for VRFs or not, just supply the process-id
- show ip ospf 1 neighbors
- show ip ospf 1 database
