### VLANs

 >  VLANs generally fall into three categories
- Standard:
  - Standard VLAN range is 1 - 1005
  - VLAN 1 - Default Ethernet Access VLAN
  - VLANs 1002 - 1005 - Default legacy Token Ring / FDDI VLANs
- Extended  - Extended VLAN range is 1006 - 4094
  - Can normally be used in one of two cases:
     > VTP is configured in Transparent Mode
     > VTP Version 3  - Not all extended VLANs can be used, some are reserved for “internal” usage
- Internal
  - VLANs reserved for internal applications 
   > e.g. native layer 3 switchports
   > show vlan internal usage

# Layer 2 Switchports

Access Switchports - One VLAN
Trunked Switchports - Multiple VLANs
Tunnel Switchports - Transparent Layer 2 VPN
Dynamic Switchports - DTP Negotiation

# Layer 2 Trunking

802.1q- Open Standard- “Native” VLAN sent untagged
DTP- Dynamic Trunking Protocol

# Disabling DTP Negotiation

> Can be disabled by…
  - switchport nonegotiate
  - switchport mode access
  - switchport mode dot1q-tunnel

# Manual Trunk Pruning

Trunk's “allowed list” controls what VLANs will forward over the link- All VLANs (1-4094) by default
Allowed list can be edited for manual pruning- switchport trunk allowed vlan

### VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP)

Used to synchronize VLAN creation between switches

Three modes:

Server
Client
Transparent

# VTP Server

Creates VLANs
Advertises VLANs
Installs VLANs from other advertisements

# VTP Client

Cannot create VLANs
Advertises VLANs
Installs VLANs from other advertisements

# VTP Transparent

Creates locally significant VLANs
Transparently forwards other VTP advertisements
Does not install VLANs from other advertisements

# VTP Pruning

Reduces unnecessary replication of..

Broadcasts
Unknown unicasts
Unknown multicast

Command for verification: show int …. pruning

VLANs 2 - 1001 are “prune eligible”

To edit prune eligible list: switchport trunk pruning vlan

VTP is Cisco proprietary

# VTP Version 3

VTP version 3 Enhancements

Security enhancements- Fixes configuration revision overwrite problem
New advertisements- Extended VLANs- Private VLANs- MST configuration
VTP can be now disabled- Globally- Per Link

### EtherChannel

Technique for aggregating the bandwidth of physical links together.

 > EtherChannels consists of two parts 
  - Port-Channel interface
  - Logical interface representing the link bundle
  - Member interfaces
  - Physical links that are part of the link bundle

# Cisco's MCEC Implementations

StackWise Cross-Stack EtherChannel
Virtual Switching System (VSS) Control plane synch over Virtual Switch Link (VSL)(Typically 2 x 10 GigE LAG)
Virtual Port Channel (vPC)Data Center platforms, e.g. Nexus 5000 / 7000 / 9000Control plane synchronized over a vPC Peer Link, Typically 2 x 10 GigE LAGTwo independent control planes in the vPCTwo independent management planes in the vPCUsually 2 active supervisors and 2 standby supervisors

# EtherChannel Negotiation Protocols

LAG negotiation comes in two forms

Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP)
Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP)

Static LAG is supported but not recommended

Failure to LAG can cause an STP loop
EtherChannel Guard can help mitigate this

EtherChannel Negotiation Modes

LAG is configure as…channel-group [number] mode [mode]

# EtherChannel Load Balancing

LAG driver is responsible for load distribution amongst members

LAG is independent of the port mode- e.g. LAG can be access, trunk, tunnel, layer 3, etc.

### Spanning-Tree Protocol

# STP Convergence Optimizations

PortFast
UplinkFast - Direct Root Port failure should reconverge immediately if Alternate Port available
BackboneFast - Indirect failures should start recalculating immediately

# STP Filters

BPDU Filter - Filter BPDUs in and out
BPDU Guard - If BPDU is received shut port down
Root Guard - If superior BPDU is received shut port down (most of the time, implemented on the Designated Ports)

Filters can be configured globally in conjunction with PortFast

# STP Loop Prevention

Loop Guard - Prevent unidirectional links by using BPDU keepalives
UDLD - Prevent unidirectional links by using UDLD keepalives

### Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol

New standard originally defined in IEEE 802.1w
Now incorporated as IEEE 802.1D-2004

# RSTP Link Types

Non-edge ports fall into two types
Point-to-point - Full-Duplex ports
Shared-Half-Duplex ports



### Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol

Started as Cisco's MISTP
Originally standard defined in IEEE 8021.s
Now standard per IEEE 802.1Q-2005

# How Does MST Work?

MST works by decoupling VLAN & STP Instance- STP Instance to VLAN mapping is user defined- Topology calculation done by RSTP

# MST Regions

MST defines a Region as bridges that agree upon…- Instance number- Revision number- VLAN to STP instance mappings

Intra vs Inter Region

Intra Region

Details of the region are known within the region
VLAN to STPIs are manually defined
Undefined VLANs fall into CIST (MST 0)

Inter Region

Details between regions are not known
Different regions see each other as virtual bridges
Result is simplified Inter-Region calculation
Intra-region MSTIs are collapsed into CIST

CIST - Common Internal Spanning Tree

# MST Configuration

Define the following in MST configuration mode (spanning-tree mst configuration)

Region name
Revision number
VLAN to instance mappings

Enable MST globally 

Real deployment must start at Root and work out
