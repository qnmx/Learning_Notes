# Securing the Management Plane - AAA

AAA:

- provides authentication, authorization and accounting for device administration
- provides authentication, authorization and accounting for network access: wired, wirelles, vpn

- Authorization
  - Defines whay you are allowed to do
  - For device administration
    - Privilage-level
    - Allowed commands
  - For network access
    - VLAN
    - Access-list
    - Security Group Tag
    - Encryption
    - VPN split tunneling policy

# AAA Model

- Three-party authentication model
  - Suplicant / end-client
    - Device requesting access
    - Speak with the authenticator
  - Authenticator
    - Device enforcing the authentication, known as NAD / NAS
    - Bridges information between suppliacnt and authentication server
  - Authentication Server
    - Device performing the authentication
    - Connected to identity sources: username/password, PKI
    - Can behave like a proxy towards another authentication server

# RADIUS

- IETF standard (RFCC2865)
  - Combines authentication and authorization in one process
  - Uses UDP port 1645/1812 for authentication
  - Uses UDP port 1646/1813 for accounting
  - Initial ports of 1645/1646 were also used by datametrics service
  - RADIUS key with MD5 used to hide/protect user's password

# TACACS+

- Developed by Cisco
  - Mainly used for device administration
  - Uses separate processes for authentication, authorization and accounting
  - Uses TCP port 49
  - Encrypts entire body of TACACS packet, leaves clear-text header

# AAA for Device Adminitration

- Two types of authentication
  - Login, allows access to user-mode
  - Enable, allows access to enable/privileged mode
- Two types of authorization
  - Exec, allows access to shell and assigns privilege-level
  - Command, restricts access to commands
- Accounting can only be done remotely via TACACS+

# IOS Privilege Levels

- Default privilege levels
  - 0 - no access
  - 1 - user mode access
  - 15  - privileged (enable) mode access
- User defined privileged levels
  - Levels 2 - 14 available for assignment

# Authentication Configuration Steps

- Start the AAA process
  aaa new model

- Configure the TACACS+ server
  Old method:
  tacacs-server host <ip_addr> key <shared_key>

- Define authentication list, mnethods allow for redundancy
  aaa authentication login <list_name> <method>
  aaa authentication enable default <method>

- Apply authentication list to desired line
  line vty 0 4
   login authentication <list_name>

# Authorization Configuration Steps

- Define authorization list, methods allow for redundancy
  aaa authorization exec <list_name> <method>
  aaa authorization commands <priv_lvl> <list_name> <method>

- Enable authorization for config-mode commands, otherwise only user-mode commands are authorized
  aaa authorization config-commands

- Enable authorization for console, otherwise it applies only to VTY access
  aaa authorization console <-- be careful with this command

- Apply authorization list to desired line
  line vty 0 4
   authorization exec <list_name>
   authorization commands <priv_lvl> <list_name>

# Accounting Configuration Steps

- Define accounting list, no fallback method
  aaa accounting exec <list_name> <method>
  aaa accounting commands <priv_lvl> <list_name> <method>

- Apply accounting list to desired line
  line vty 04
   accounting exec <list_name>
   accounting commands <priv_lvl> <list_name>

Note: if a non default list was used in authentication, authorization and accounting, those lists will need to be applied to specyfic lines

# AAA Verification Steps

- Verify the TACACS+ server
  show tacacs
  show aaa servers detailed
  show pprivileged level

- Verify the AAA lists
  show aaa method-lists all

- Test authentication against TACACS+ server
  test aaa group tacacs+ <username> <password> legacy

# SSH configuration steps

- Configure hostname and domain-name (for RSA generation)
- Generate RSA public-private key-pair (for encryption)

# Syslog

- Router can be configured to send log messages to
  - Console
  - VTY lines
  - Buffer
  - Remote syslog server (runs over UDP 514 by default)
    - Optionally TCP can be used

- Log messages have different severity levels, with level 7 providing the most output

0 - emergencies 
1 - alerts
2 - critical
3 - errors
4 - warnings
5 - notifications
6 - ifnromational
7 - debugging

- Never enable level 7 at the console, it will melt down router CPU!
  bad example: debup ip packet
- debugging level should only be performed to the buffer not to the console or vty lines, also do not perform debugging level to the syslog server

# Syslog configuration steps

- Enable logging, enabled by default
  logging on

- Define console, VTY and buffer as destinations
  logging console <level>
  logging monitor <level> (VTY lines)
  logging buffer <buffer_size>  <level>

- Define syslog server as destination
  logging host <ip_address>
  logging trap <level>

# Syslog verification

  show logging

# NTP

- Network Time Protocol
- Runs over UDP, port 123
- NTP configuration steps
- NTP server
  ntp master
  ntp authentication-key # md5 string
  ntp trusted-key #
- NTP client
  ntp authentication-key # md5 string
  ntp trusted-key #
  ntp authenticate ! to authenticate a time source
  ntp server <ip_address> key <key_nr>


# SNMP
- Simple Network Management Protocol
- Three versions
  SNMPv1
  SNMPv2c
  SNMPv3
- SNMP Roles
  SNMP agent is the network device
  SNMP manager is the SNMP server
- It is based on three main methods
  SNMP GET (read device statistics, like interface statistics) - UDP 161
  SNMP SET (configure the device remotly, like VTP configuration) - UDP 161
  SNMP TRAP (receives unsolicited events from device) - UDP 162, can optionally use TCP (called INFORM)

# SNMPv3
- SNMPv3 adds mainly security features
- SNMPv3 security models
  nonauthnopriv (username authentication only as community)
  authnopriv (username/password authenticaion via MD5)
  authpriv (username/password authentication via MD5 and encryption via DES/3DES/AES)

# SNMPv3 configuration steps
- Define a group of users and security level
  snmp-server group <group_name> v3 <security_level>
- Define authentication user, associate it with the group
  snmp-server user <user_name> <group_name> v3 auth <algorithm> <auth_key> priv <algorithm> <encryption_key>
- Define the SNMP server
  snmp-server host <ip_address> traps version 3 <security_level> <user_name>
- Define traps
  snmp-server enable traps ?
- Enable SNMP traps on the interface
  snmp trap link-status

# SNMPv3 verification steps
- Verify users and groups
  show snmp group
  show snmp user
- Verify SNMP servers
  show snmp host
  show snmp sessions

# Zone Based Firewall Policy Elements
- Claas Map
  Identifying Traffic:
  - Access Lists
  - User Groups
  - Protocl
  - Nested Class-Maps(s)
- Policy Map
  Actions to Take:
  - PASS - Simply permits traffic (No state table entry)
  - DROP - Drop traffic
  - INSPECT - Permit traffic and create state table entry
  - LOG - Log dropped traffic
- Service Policy
  Applies Service Policy to Zone Pairs
  - Single statement applied
  - Directionality is part of the zone pair
- Zone Pairs
  Traffic Flow Between Two Zones
  - Unidirectional
  - Does not affect traffic within a zone
  - Soure and destination zones specified
  - Traffic dropped if no policy exists

# ASA Features/Functionality
- Packet Fitlering
  Access-Lists, permit/deny
  Named only
  Standard or Extended
  Network Masks
- Stateful Inspection/Filtering
  Permit/deny plus state table
  
# ASA NAT Support
  Static NAT
  Dynamic NAT
  PAT
  Exemption/Policy 

# ASA Factory Default
  conf t
  config factory-default

# Threat Detection Techniques
- Signature-Based
- Anomaly-Based
  Method of IDS/IPS detection that uses deviation from baseling network traffic behavior to determine potentially dangerous traffic
- Policy-Based
- Reputation-Based, Ironport devices

# Intrusion Detection Terminology
- False Positive - false alarm, legitimate traffic triggers a system alarm
- False Negative - Malicious traffic has not been detected
- Tru Positive - Alerts are not beeing generated, genuine traffic
- True Negative - Malicious traffic is caught and detected by IDS/IPS
