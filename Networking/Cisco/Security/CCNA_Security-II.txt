### Learning Notes II ###

---------------------------------------------------------------
		Security Concepts
---------------------------------------------------------------

# CIA
- Confidentiality - use of encryption to protect the data
- Integrity - use of hash to verify the integrity of the data
- Availability - making sure that access to data is available

# Logging
- Options to send logs to
  Console
  Monitor - VTY line
  Memory buffer
  Flash memory
  Syslog server
  SNMP trap

# SIEM Capabilities
- Data aggregation
- Correlation
- Alerting
- Dashboards
- Compliance check
- Retention
- Forensic analysis

# Security Terms
- Vulnerability - A weakness that compromises either the security or the functionality of a system
- Exploit - The mechanism that is used to leverage a vulnerability to compromise the security or functionality of the system
- Threat - Any circumstance or event with the potential to cause harm to an asset in the form of destruction, disclosure, adverse modification of data, or DoS
Risk - The likelihood that a particular threat using a specific attack will exploit a particular vulnerability of an asset that results in an undesirable consequence

# Cryptography Concepts
- Cryptanalysis - Finding and exploiting weaknesses in cryptography algorithms
- Hash
  echo -n "Hello World" | md5sum
- Symmetric Encryption Algorithms
  Same Key
  40-256-bit keys, Do not use less than 80-bit keys today
  Fast, used for VPNs
  Key management is a challenge - Must have a common secret key before exchange. Must keep the key a secret
  DES, 3DES, AES, IDEA, RC4, Blowfish
- Asymmetric Encryption Algorithms
  Uses key pairs. Public and private
  Encrypt with a private key - decrypt with a public key
  Encrypt with a public key - decrypt with a private key
  Key length from 512-4096 bits
  RSA, DSA, Elliptic curve
- Digital Signatures
  Remember to encrypt with a private key - all with a public key can decrypt
  Data is large - expensive to do this
  Instead, hash the data and encrypt the hash

---------------------------------------------------------------
		AAA Concepts
---------------------------------------------------------------

# AAA
- Authentication, Authorization and Accounting
- Two types: Administrative Access (Devices login), Remote User Acess (User authentication)

- Configure AAA
Add username/password
  username USER secret SECRET

Enable AAA
  aaa new-model

Create TACACS group
  aaa group server tacacs+ NAME
  server-private X.X.X.X key SECRET

Configure authentication method lists
  aaa authentication login default local - default authentication is set to local
  aaa authentication login default/NAME group tacacs+/GROUP_NAME local - authenticate via TACACS Server, then local as a backup
Attach authentication method to the console line  
  line console 0
  login authentication default
Attach authentication method to the VTY lines
  line vty 0 4
  login authentication default/NAME

Test aaa authentication
  test aaa group tacacs+ USER PASSWD new-code

Configure authorization method lists
Configure accounting method lists

# TACACS+ and RADIUS
- Network device to server communication
- ACS supports both
- ISE supports both as of version 2.x
- TACACS = TCP/49
- RADIUS has robust API and accounting
- RADIUS = UDP/1812&1813

# SSH Setup
- Create ip domain name
  ip domain-name NAME
  crypto key generate rsa modulus 2048 label NAME
  ip ssh version 2
- Update VTY lines
  line vty 0 4
  transport input ssh

# Create access per privilege level
  privilege exec level X command_name 
  enable secret level X SECRET

# Creating Parser Views
- Enter enable mode NAME
  enable view
- Enter global configuration mode
- Create a parser view
  parser view NAME
- Set the view password
  secret 0 SECRET
- Define the available commands
  commands exec include all show

# Accessing Parser Views
enable [view name]
show parser view [all]

---------------------------------------------------------------
		Secure Management  
---------------------------------------------------------------

# Managing Files
- copy
- pwd
- cd nvram:
- dir
- delete
- squeeze

nvram - storage for startup config
startup - storage for RAM

# IOS Resiliency
secure boot-image
secure boot-config

# CPU Thresholding
process cpu threshold type total rising 80 interval 5
rising X - send SNMP trap when CPU of the device is higher than X over configured span of time
falling X - send SNMP trap when there is underutilization of CPU
- SNMP Traps are required for CPU thresholding to work 

# Management ACLs
- Secure VTY lines
access-list X permit X
line vty 0 4
access-class X in

- Secure HTTP/HTTPS Access
ip http access-class X(ACL)

---------------------------------------------------------------
               Security on Cisco Routers
---------------------------------------------------------------

# CoPP - Control Plane Policing
- Consist of three elements
  Class Map
  Policy Map
  Service Policy

access-list 101 permit X X X
class-map class_NAME
match access-group ACL_NR/NAME
show class-map

policy-map Policy_NAME
class class_NAME
police rate 8000
exit
exit

control-plane
service-policy input Policy_Name
log message: %CP-5-FEATURE: Control-plane Policing feature enabled on Control plane aggregate path
show policy-map control-plane

# CPPr - Control Plane Protection
- More granular than CoPP
- Three different Control Planes
  Host Interface - Traffic destined to one of the interfaces of the router, SSH, SMNP
  Transit Interface - Traffic that is passing through the router, but needs additional processing, (traffic that could not be moved to Data Plane traffic). Example: Tunnel passing through the router
  CEF Exception - All the other traffic, that is sent to the router's processor. Sample: CDP, packets with TTL of 1, ARP, eBGP, OSPF, no IP traffic

- Configuration is very similar to CoPP feature.
  When doing the last step:
  control-plane cef-exception|host|transit
- Log message: %CP-5-FEATURE: Control-plane Policing feature enabled on Control plane host path

# Routing Protocols Authentication
# OSPF
- create a key chain
key chain NAME
key 1
key-string PASSWD
cryptographic-algorithm hmac-sha-256

- Add a key chain to interfaces running OSPF
int Gi0/0
ip ospf authentication key-chain NAME

# EIGRP
- create a key chain same as OSPF key chain
- Add key chain to interface running EIGRP
ip authentication mode eigrp X md5
ip authentication key-chain eigrp X key-chain_NAME 


---------------------------------------------------------------
               802.1X Authentication
---------------------------------------------------------------

# 802.1X
- IEEE designed protocol to perform port-based authentication

# Definition of Terms
- Supplicant - a software that is installed on a client device
  Windows native client: Services > Wired AutoConfig > Startup type: Automatic > Start
                         Properties of Ethernet adapter > Authentication > Enable IEEE 802.1X authentication
  Dedicated client: Cisco AnyConnect Client, Network Access Manager
- Authenticator - an Access level switch, an Access Point, ASA, Cisco Router
- Authentication Server - ISE (policies)

# Protocol Communicaton
- EAP
- EAP-MD5
- EAP-TLS
- PEAP

# Actions
- DACL - Downloadable ACL, configured on ISE
  This is downloaded by the switch and applied to the port, where a machine is connected to
- VLAN Assignment
- Redirect URL, seen in a guest access

# Process Flow
- EAP-Start - initial messages when a device is connected to the network (user access switch)
- Access-Request - message sent by the Authenticator to the Authentication Server
- Access-Accept - message sent by ISE to Authenticator
- EAP-Success - message sent by the Authenticator to the end machine (PC, laptop)


---------------------------------------------------------------
               Common Layer 2 Attacks
---------------------------------------------------------------
- VLAN Hopping - Native VLAN mismatch
- Double Tagging - Scapy tool
- MAC Spoofing - changing MAC address
- CAM Table Overflow Attacks - macof
- ARP Cache Poisoning, Ettercap


---------------------------------------------------------------
               Mitigating Layer 2 Attacks
---------------------------------------------------------------
# Protecting Trunk Links
- switchport nonegotiate
- switchport trunk allowed vlan x-y
- switchport trunk native vlan 999

# Limit MAC Addresses on a Port
- switchport port-security
- switchport port-security maximum
  Protect: Drops Packets
  Restrict: Drops Packets plus Syslog message
  Shutdown: Error-Disabled State

# Private VLANs
- Layer 2 Isolation
- Traffic controlled by three sub-vlans
  Isolated - ports assigned to isolated VLAN can talk with DG
  Community - ports assigned to community VLAN can talk with eachother 
  Promiscuous - DG
- PVLANs can span across multiple switches

# PVLAN Edge
- Control Ports from talking to one another
- Protected Commands
- Only works for ports on the same switch
- Configuration: switchport protected

# ACLs 

<1-99>            IP standard access list
<100-199>         IP extended access list
<1300-1999>       IP standard access list (expanded range)
<2000-2699>       IP extended access list (expanded range)

---------------------------------------------------------------

# DHCP Snooping
- Global Commands:
  ip dhcp snooping vlan X
  no ip dhcp snooping information option
  ip dhcp snooping
- Interface Commands:

---------------------------------------------------------------
               Features of Cisco ASA 9.X
---------------------------------------------------------------
# Logging
logging enable
logging host X.X.X.X - To send log messages to a Syslog Server
logging trap - Set logging level or list for syslog server

- Logging on ASA is very extensive, use logging buffer to log messages to the buffer

# Features of the Cisco ASA
- Application-aware stateful packet inspection engine
- Flows based  on source and destination addresses and ports - show conn
- Rich IP routing functionality - OSPF, EIGRP, RIP and BGP support
- IPv6 support
- Natively integrates with multicast networks
- Provides for an integrated DHCP server and client
- Robust support of varying NAT scenarios

# Modes of Deployment
- Single Routed Mode (default) - L3 operation
- Single Transparent Mode - L2 operation
- Multiple Context Routed Mode
- Multiple Context Transparent Mode

# High Availability, Failover and Clustering
- Active/Standby Failover
- Active/Active Failover
- Clustering, bundling multiple ASA into one logical unit, communication between ASAs is exchanged via CCL, Cluster Control Link

# Overview of the Cisco ASA CLI Command Set
- Five CLI modes
- ROM monitor mode - used for low-level configuration, e.g. password recovery
- User EXEC mode
- Privilege EXEC mode
- Global configuration mode
- Specific configuration mode

# Basic Consfiguration of ASA
- IP address
- Enable HTTP Server
  http server enable - command enables HTTPS Server
  http X.X.X.X X.X.X.X - Allow access to HTTP Server from specific host/subnet
  http 0 0 Interface_NAME - Allow access to anybody on specified interface
- Allow ASDM Access

# Interface Configuration
- To clear Interface configuration
  clear configure interface X/X

- IP address
- Name - nameif
- Security Levels - traffic from the interface with a higher security value is allowed to pass, to the interface with the lower security value
- Allow the same security level interfaces to communicate with each other
  same-security-traffic permit inter-interface
- Configuration wizard - setup command, requires management interface


---------------------------------------------------------------
            	NAT and Access Control
---------------------------------------------------------------

# Allow ICMP through ASA
By default, the ASA has a global inspection policy that doesn’t permit ICMP traffic. If you want to ping between devices through your ASA firewall then we have to inspect ICMP traffic, you can do it like this:

ASA1(config)# policy-map global_policy
ASA1(config-pmap)# class inspection_default
ASA1(config-pmap-c)# inspect icmp

- NAT RFC - 1631
- Inside local IP address
  The IPv4 address assigned to a host on the inside network
  The address is typically an RFC 1918 address
- Inside global IP address
  A legitimate IPv4 address that represents one or more inside local IPv4 addresses to the outside world. This is a translated IP address.
- Outside local IP address
  The IPv4 address of an outside host as it appears to the inside network
- Outside global IP address
  The IPv4 address that is assigned to a host on the outside network by the host owner

# NAT Types
- Static
  Maps an unregistered IPv4 address to a registered IPv4 address. One-to-one static NAT is particularly useful when a device must be accessible from an outside network.
- Dynamic
  Maps an unregistered IPv4 address to a registered IPv4 address from a group of registered IPv4 addresses.
- Overload
- Policy NAT
  Uses ACLs to perform NAT differently according to ACL criteria (source addresses, destination addresses, ports)

# Object-Based NAT
- Overcomes constraints from 8.2 and earlier versions of ASA OS
- Network Object
  A Host, Translated Address and Service Network Object is created for translation
  Network Object is a host address, network address or range of addresses.

# ASA NAT Table
- Manual NAT (Section 1)
  Enables the administrator to define translations that the appliance compares before the other two sections
- Auto NAT (Section 2)
  Also, referred to as object NAT, contains translations that are defined in the object itself
- Manual NAT after Auto NAT (Section 3)
  Contains more general translations that are not handled by the sections above

# Static NAT Configuration
- ASDM: Configuration > Firewall > NAT Rules
- Sample configuration:

object network NAME_1
host X.X.X.X
description DESCRIPTION
object network NAME_2
host X.X.X.X
nat 1 source static NAME_1 NAME_2 unidirectional

- NAT verification
  show xlate
  show nat

# Dynamic NAT
- Sample configuration:

object network Pool_NAME
range X.X.X.X X.X.X.X
description DESCRIPTION
object network NAME
description DESCRIPTION
nat dynamic Pool_NAME

# PAT
- Sample configuration:

nat (any,OUTSIDE) after-auto 1 source dynamic any interface

# Access-lists Overview
- Filtering direction
  Interface - Applied inbound or outbound
  Global - Policy affects all interfaces in the inbound direction
           Rules evaluated after explicit interface access rules
# Configuring ACLs for an Interface
- Access rules reference the "Real" (non-translated) IP address

# Sessions between interfaces with the same security level
- Must be explicitly enabled
- Connectivity is governed by the access rules on the relevant interface

# Sample configuration

access-list OUTSIDE_access_in line 1 extended permit tcp any object PC-2 eq https 
access-group OUTSIDE_access_in in interface OUTSIDE

# MPF - Modular Policy Framework
- Facilitates many additional access controls on network flows
- Complements ACLs, does note replace them
- Implemented with the following main components
  Class Maps
  Policy Maps
  Service Policies

- By defaul, the Cisco ASA configuration includes a policy, applied globally, that matches all default application inspection traffic and applies inspeciton to the traffic
- The Cisco ASA security applicance supports one global policy map and one policy map per interface

- Create a new service policy rule or edit an existing one
- Identify which traffic to match (class map)
- Apply actions to the traffic (policy map)
- Verification - show service-policy

---------------------------------------------------------------
                Zone-based Firewalls
---------------------------------------------------------------
# ZBFW Overview
- Allows grouping of physical adn virtual interfaces into zones
- Applies firewall policies to traffic that traverses zones
- Makes it simple to add or remove interfaces and integrate them into the firewall policy

https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/ios-firewall/98628-zone-design-guide.html

# Zones Overview
- A collection of networks reachable over a specific set of router interfaces
- A given interface belongs to one zone and one zone only
- The self zone is system-defined and applies to traffic to or from the router itself

# Zone Pairs Overview
- Zones are grouped into source/destination pairs to facilitate policy assignment
- Separate resources into zones based on resource sensitivity and thrustworthiness

# Default Values
- Interfaces in the same zone can communicate without restrictions
- All traffic is denied between zones

# C3PL
- Cisco Common Classification Policy Language
- Class maps
  Identify traffic at OSI Layers 3 through 7
  Use multiple matching criteria
- Policy maps
  Define policy for traffic at Layers 3 through 7
- Service policies
  Activate policy maps for traffic flows on specific direction of zone pairs

https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/access/cisco_router_and_security_device_manager/24/software/user/guide/C3PL.html

# Class Maps
- Class Maps classify traffic by using different match criteria
  Access control list
  Protocol
  Other class maps
- Each class map can have multiple match statements
- Logical AND/OR statements are accomplished using the match type (match-all/match-any)
- Classes within a policy are evaluated in order of configuration

# Syntax for Class Maps
class-map type inspect match-all|match-any NAME_CM
match access-group ACL_#
match protocol #
match class-map NAME_CM

# Possible actions a Policy Map can take
- Inspect - statefull entry for the traffic
- Permit - allowing a packet, without creating a state entry
- Drop
- Log

# Policy Map
- Unclassified traffic match the default class, referred to as class-default
- The default action in the class-default class is to drop traffic
- Default action can be customized per policy map to implement appropriate default actions

# Syntax for Policy Map
policy-map type inspect NAME_PM
class type inspect NAME_CM
inspect

# Syntax for Zone-pairs
zone security INSIDE
zone security OUTSIDE
interface X
zone-member security INSIDE|OUTSIDE
zone-pair security IN>OUT source INSIDE destination OUTSIDE
service-policy type inspect NAME_PM
