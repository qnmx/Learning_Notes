### Junos CLI Operational Mode

Help with Configuration Syntax

help topic …help reference … - offers configuration syntaxhelp apropos - offers configuration syntax help

### Junos CLI Configuration Mode

Multiple users (up to 32 users) can enter and commit changes in configuration mode
Use the configure exclusive command to exclude other users from editing the configurationAny uncommitted changes are discarded when users exit
Use the configure private command to enable users to edit private copies of candidate configuration concurrentlyWhen users issue a commit, their private changes merge back into the global configurationIf private users issue a rollback 0 command, the software discard only their changes
Use set to add configuration statements
Use the delete command to remove statements
Use the deactivate command to cause the specified portion of the configuration hierarchy to be ignored while still retaining the original configuration
Use the activate command to place the configuration back into effect

You just disabled an interface with a set interfaces <interface-name> disable statement. How do you re-enable this interface?

Issue a delete interfaces <interface-name> disable command to delete the disable statement placed into effect with the referenced set command.

If multiple Routing Engines (REs) are installed, use the commit synchronise command
Use the commit confirmed command to temporarily activateWait 10 minutes (default) for user to enter second commit. If not confirmed, rollback the configuration
Use commit at to schedule a future commitshow system commitclear system commit
You can complete the commit process in two steps:- Use commit prepare to validate the configuration- Use commit activate to apply the configuration changes
Compare activate and historical configurations:show configuration | compare rollback <number>
Compare arbitrary files:file compare files <filename1> <filename2>
A rescue configuration permits you to define a known working configuration
Issue the request system configuration rescue save command to save the most recently committed configuration as the rescue configuration
The ephemeral database is an alternate configuration database that provides a fast programmatic interface for performing configuration updates on devices running Junos OS
Is advantageous in dynamic environments where fast provisioning and rapid configuration changes are requiredEphemeral databases - https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/junos-xml-protocol/topics/concept/ephemeral-configuration-database-overview.html
Use the save command to save current configuration. The command save <filename>
Use the load command to load a configuration file

### J-Web Interface

J-Web uses the same authentication methods as the CLI
Enable the HTTP or HTTPS service under the [ edit system services ] hierarchy level

[ edit system services web-management ]

http {       interface X;}https {         system-generated-certificate;         interface all;}

### Initial System Configuration

# Loading a Factory-Default Configuration

Use the load-factory-default command to:- Return a device to a factory default configuration- Overwrite the candidate configuration- Must set root password to activate configuration  set system root-authentication plain-text-password

# Gracefully Shutting Down the Junos OS

Gracefully shut down the Junos OS before removing power- Use the request system halt command to gracefully halt the Junos OS and help ensure file system integrity  New command to power off: request system power-off- When the Junos OS has been halted, system power is maintained

# The Rescue Configuration

Use the request system configuration rescue save command to save the active configuration as the rescue configuration using the CLI's operational mode

# User Authentication

Password Complexity Requirements- Minimum length of 6 characters- Can include most character classes: Alphabetic, Numeric, Special (except control characters)- Must have at least one change of case or character class

set system login user <username> authentication plan-text-password

# Predefined Login Privilege Classes

operator: clear, network, reset, trace, view; no configuration changes are allowed
read-only: view
super-user: all
unauthorised: none

# Centralised User Authentication

Configuring a RADIUS Clientset system radius-server <IP address> secret <password>
Configuring a TACACS+ Clientset system tacplus-server <IP address> secret <password>


Set the identification parametersHostname: set host-name NAME
Set the time parameters: set system time-zoneset date - at operational level
Set management access parametersSSH: set system services ssh root-login allowJ-Web: set system services web-management http interface fxp0.0
Set the idle timeoutAt operational mode: set cli idle-timeout VALUE - only applied to the current sessionConfiguration mode: set system login idle-timeout VALUE - permanent idle timeout for all sessions
Set the login messageset system login message “VALUE”
Configure a Static Route for Managementedit routing-optionsset static route X.X.X.X/X next-hop X.X.X.X no-readvertiseAdd “no-readvertise” to avoid the route being re-advertised into any other routing protocols

# Interface Types

Management - fxp0, me0
Internal - fxp1, em1 - connects the control and forwarding planes
Network - ge, xe, et - provides media-specific network connectivity
Services - provide specific capabilities for manipulating traffic before it is delivered to its destinationes - encryption interfacegr - GRE tunnel interfaceip - IP-over-IP encapsulation tunnel interfacels - Link service interfaceml - Multilink interfacemo - Passive monitoring interfacemt - Multicast tunnel interfacesp - Adaptive services interfacevt - Virtual tunnel interface
Loopback - lo0 - Junos devices use the lo0 designation for this interfaceOnly one loopback interface exists, more cannot be createdOnly one logical unit can be created per routing instance

Most interfaces are named according to:- Interface media type - ge, xe, et- Line card (FPC) slot number- Interface card (PIC) slot number- Port numberExample:ge-0/2/3 = port 3 of a Gigabit Ethernet PIC in slot 2 on FPC 0

Logical Units- similar to subinterfaces used by other vendors

Interface Properties

Physical properties settings include:- Data Link Layer protocol- Link speed and duplex- Speed- Physical MTU- Clocking- FCS- Scrambling- Diagnostic characteristics
Logical properties settings include- Protocol family: inet, inet6, ISO (is-is), mpls, ethernet-switching- Addresses (IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and ISO NET address)- VLAN tagging- Firewall filters that are operating on the interface

Physical and logical interface properties are configured at their respective levelinterfaces <interface-name> physical-properties

interfaces <interface-name> unit <unit-number> logical-properties



Ether-switching cannot be configured along with other protocol families
Configuration of multiple IP addresses is supported on Juniper devices
Use the preferred option to select source address when trying to reach an address on that same networkBy default a numerically lowest local address is chosen
Use the primary option for source address when packet transfer originates from the interface and the destination address does not indicate the subnetBy default a numerically lowest address is chosen as a primary

# NTP

RFC 5905
Configure NTP Boot Server. Tell Junos which NTP server to get its time from when it boots upset system ntp boot-server (name | ip-address)
Configure an NTP Reference Serverset system ntp server (name | ip-address)
NTP Verification Commandsshow system uptimeshow ntp statusshow ntp associations

# SNMP

Management Information Base (MIB)- Hierarchical database of status information and statistics- Branch and leaf structure- Standard (IETF) and proprietary- SNMP Managers view or change objects in the MIB
Object Identifier (OID)- Unique string of numbers identifying the branch or leaf in the MIB
SNMP Message Types:- Get - requests to the agent. Agent responds with data. Port 161.- Set - Manager changes the value of a MIB object. Agent responds with status.- Notification - Agent send “traps” to notify the manager of events e.g. link down. Port 162.
Enable the SNMP v2c Agent- Configure either the common community “public” or another community and specify the permissions. Best practice to specify IP address or range for SNMP managers to accept connections fromset snmp community (community | public) authorization (read-only | read-write) clients (prefix)
Configure SNMP Trapsedit snmp trap-group NAME categories ?edit snmp trap-group NAME targets IP_Addr (NMS)

# Archiving

Junos active configuration is stored in /config/juniper.conf.gz
Manual File Copy- Default to SCP and will attempt connect with the user account logged into the devicefile copy /config/juniper.conf.gz server:/directory
Configure Archive Sites- Junos tries these in order and if the first one works, then it won't use the next in the listset system archival configuration archive-sites ftp://username:password@server/dirset system archival configuration archive-sites scp://username:password@server/dir
Configure When to Archiveset system archival configuration archive-sites transfer-on-commit

# System Logging

configuration available at edit system syslog
to view log messages: show log messages
saved at /var/log

# Trace Files

Other vendors call this debugging. Used to troubleshoot specific issues
Should be turned off when no longer required
Specify what information to log and destination to send it to (file or remote server)
Traceoptions configured at various level e.g. [edit protocols ospf]
delete traceoptions - to stop tracing
To send tracelogs to remote destination:set system tracing destination-ovveride syslog host (IP address)
To view traceoptions at terminalmonitor start FileName

# Configuration Groups

Allow repetitive configuration chunks to be organised in a template
Group configuration occurs at the [edit groups] hierarchy
It's possible to determine if a particular configuration comes from groups, by using the “display inheritance” pipe parameter
To match all interfaces: <ge-*>
To match any character (static route, IP address, etc.): <*>

# RPM -Real-Time Performance Monitoring

RPM allows the device to create accurate traffic measurements
Tests can be created to get a measure on packet loss, jitter and round trip time
TCP and UDP probes are Juniper proprietary
Receiving device needs to be configured to be an RPM receiver in order for such tests to work properly
Configured in the [services rpm probe-server] hierarchy

# Upgrading the Junos OS

Perform a snapshot of the system configuration and current Junos versionrequest system snapshot slice alternatepotentially disruptive command
Specify the URL or pathname of package. Can be local or remote FTP or SCP location
Reboot is required to activate - add ‘reboot’ at the end to do this automatically
request system software add <package-name>

# Pre-defined Junos Routing Tables

inet.0 - IPv4 unicast routes
inet.1 - Multicast forwarding cache
inet.2 - Multicast Border Gateway Protocol (MBGP) routes to provide reverse path forwarding (RPF) checks
inet.3 - MPLS path information
inet.4 - Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) route entries
inet6.0 - IPv6 unicast routes
mpls.0 - MPLS next hops

# Forwarding table

To view forwarding table: show route forwarding-table
perm - permanent route, installed by the Junos kernel
user - route come from routing protocol or user configuration
intf - installed in a table as a result of configuring an interface
dest - remote subnet, reachable via interface

# Routing Instance

Collection of routing tables, interfaces, and routing protocol parameters
Multiple routing tables within a routing instance e.g. IPv4 and IPv6
Unique name and associated unicast IP routing table e.g. customerA.inet.0
Default routing instance called “master” linked to the main inet.0 routing table

# Routing Instance Types

forwarding: to implement Filter-Based Forwarding
l2vpn: used in layer 2 VPN
no-forwarding: used for administrative separation
virtual-router: used for router device virtualisation
vpls: used for VPLS (L2) implementations
vrf: used in MPLS (L3) implementations

To configure:

set routing-instances Additional_Instance instance-type virtual-router

set routing-instances Additional_Instance interface X

# Static Routing

Configured manually at the [edit routing-options] level of the configuration hierarchy
IPv4 Default Static Routeset static route 0.0.0.0/0 next-hop X.X.X.X (no-readvertise)
IPv6 Default Static Routeset rib inet6.0 static route ::/0 next hop 2000::1
Static Route with an Indirect Next HopNext hop is not directly connected. Specify “resolve” to make Junos do a recursive lookup of the next hopAlso requires a route to to the next hop, preferably learned from a dynamic protocol such as OSPFset static route 1.1.1.1/32 next-hop X.X.X.X.X resolve
Static Route with a qualified next hopUse preference to make sure the 2nd route is not used unless the first route is downOther vendor call this a “floating static route”qualified-next-hop X.X.X.X preference X

# Dynamic Routing Protocols

Adding a Link into OSPFSpecify the area number and interfaceJunos assumes unit 0 if not specifiedOptionally use “passive” option to prevent neighbour adjecencies forming on an interfaceset protocols ospf area 0 interface X (passive)
Display OSPF Neighbour Adjecenciesshow ospf neighbor



### Routing Policy and Firewall Filters

# Routing Policies

Routing polices control the flow of routing information into and out of the routing table
Applied at the point of entry to and exit from the routing table
Modify route attributes as they enter or leave the routing table

# Routing Policy Types

Import: Applied before routes enter the routing table. Control which routes enter the table
Export: Applied as active routes are advertised to a neighbour or installed in the forwarding table

# Default Policies - BGP

BGP's import policy is to accept all BGP routes
BGP's export policy is to send all active BGP routes

# Default Policies - OSPF

OSPF's import policy is to accept all OSPF routes
OSPF's export policy is to reject all OSPF routes; the protocol floods routing information
OSPF routes can not be restricted via import policy

# Default Policies - IS-IS

same as OSPF

# Default Policies - RIP

RIP's import policy is to accept all RIP routes
RIP's export policy is to reject all RIP's routes; custom policy needs to be configured in order to export routes

# Routing Policy Definition

Defined at the policy-options level of the configuration [edit policy-options]
Term1 else if Term2 else if default protocol policies
policy-statement NAME - User-defined name for the policy; Should be meaningful to aid in troubleshooting
term NAME- User-defined term- A Policy can contain zero or more terms- Evaluated sequentially until terminating action or end of policy- if…then statements- Can be re-ordered if required with the “insert” command
from protocol [rip direct]- “if” part- Defines the criteria to match routes against- Logical OR for single match criteria- Logical AND for multiple match criteria
then accept- “then” statement- defines the actions to take against routes that match the “from” statement- If a terminating action (accept/reject) then evaluation stops- First match

# Prefix-List

List of subnets
configured at the policy-options prefix-list configuration level
Two uses in “from” statements- Prefix list statement (matches only if an exact match with a prefix on the list)- Prefix list filter can use match types (exact, longer, orlonger)

# Route Filter

List of prefixes
Can only be used within a single routing policy or policy term
Can use match typesexact, longer, or orlonger, through, upto, prefix-length-rangeupto, through - include last route as well
Can specify an actions in the from statement

# Routing Policy Actions

Terminate policyAcceptReject
Control flowNext-termNext policy
Modify attributesBGP communitiesRoute preference

# Multiple Filters Evaluation

A specific term within a routing policy can accept more than one route filter
When more than one route filter in the match criteria exists, an ‘OR’ logic is used among filters
An ‘AND’ logic is still used to combine the filter with other match criteria
When a route matches more than one filter, the longest prefix is matched, regardless of the match type applied to the filter

# Routing Policy Application - Hierarchy Levels

BGP: Protocol, group, neighbour

OSPF, IS-IS: Protocol

RIP- Protocol and neighbour (import)- Group (export)



Only the most specific policy applied

# Firewall Filter Concepts, Match Criteria and Actions

Access Control List (ACL)
Stateless
Defined at the firewall level of the configuration and the protocol family[edit firewall family inet]
filter NAMEUser-defined name for filter
discard - silently drop the packet
reject - drop the packet and send ICMP unreachable message
If there are multiple matching criteria in one term, all must match to take effect. AND operation
Any packet that do not match specific term are discarded by default
If a filter term matches, and the action is a modifier with no accompanying terminating action then it is accompanied by an implicit accept optionterm 1from {A}then {log} # implicit accept
The implicit accept action can be negated through use of the next term flow control actionsthen {log; next term;}

# Match Criteria - IP Addresses

Source address
Destination address
Address (regardless of whether it's src or dst)
Source Prefix list
Destination Prefix list
Prefix list (regardless of whether it's src or dst)

# Flow Control

The only control action available in firewall filters is the ‘next-term’
Given that action modifiers have a default ‘accept’ action attached to them, you might want to modify the packet and still have it be evaluated against more criteria in the filters

# Control Plane Protection

Standard Firewall Filter protects transit traffic
To control access to Control Plane, apply a filter at loopback interface

# Firewall Filter Application

Applied at the interface level[interfaces X.X.X unit X family inet]
set filter [input output]

# Define Policer

configured at firewall level
set policer NAME
reference Policer in the Firewall Filterthen policer NAME
Policer can be referenced in multiple filters

# Monitoring Firewall Activity

show firewall filter NAME
show firewall counter filter NAME
show firewall log
clear firewall filter NAME counter NAME

# Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) Checks 

RPF is a security mechanism to prevent IP address spoofing- Checks that packets are received on the expected interface- Checks for an active route to the packet source- If the check fails then the packet is dropped
uRPF is not needed all across the topology; enable on routers with untrusted networks
Strict ModeDefault/preferred mode. Looks for an active path to the source IP address
Loos ModeOnly checks for a valid route, so a default route would be acceptable
RPF checks can be used with firewall filters
Enable the “feasible paths” option to allow for asymmetric routingThe Feasible Path option accepts traffic from inactive paths if they're valid to the destination.Applied at [edit routing-options forwarding table] unicast-reverse-path feasible-paths
uRPF is applied at [edit interfaces X.0 family X]

# Fail Filters

Fail filters are a special type of firewall filter
Fail filters act on traffic failing uRPF check
It's not possible to log packets dropped by uRPF via regular filters; fail filters can
uRPF checks happen before firewall filters
