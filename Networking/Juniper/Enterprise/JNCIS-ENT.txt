# Layer 2 Switching and VLANs

# EX Series Switches
- These are Juniper's line of Enterprise switches, designed to offer low latency and high throughput for campus LANs.

# Native VLANs
- Junos, by default, tags all VLAN traffic
- If a switch receives a tagged frame for the native VLAN, the frame is dropped
- Native VLANs can be a security risk. VLAN 1 should never be the native VLAN

# ARP
- ARP cache is kept for 20 minutes

# RVI
- Routed VLAN Interfaces

# Creating VLANs

edit vlans
set NAME vlan-id X

# Set interfaces as trunk

edit interfaces X.X family ethernet-switching
set port-mode trunk # EX Series
set interface-mode trunk # QFX Series
set vlan members VLAN_NAME
set native-vlan-id X

# Assign VLAN to an interface

edit interfaces X.X family ethernet-switching
set vlan members VLAN_NAME

edit vlan NAME
set interface X

# Interface Range

edit interfaces interface-range NAME
set member X 
set member-range X to X
