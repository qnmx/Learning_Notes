- Server Core and Desktop Experience
- New major release every 3 years or so
- No semi-annual feature updates

Semi-Annual Channel
- Standard and Datacenter editions
- Server Core version
- New "feature update" release twice per year (spring, fall)
- Numbered in "yymm" format

# Three Licensing Models

Retail
- Purchase of the software only, from Microsoft or from service providers

OEM
- Purchase of a software/hardware bundle, with factory-installed licenses

Volume licensing
- License not tied to hardware

- Windows Server 2012 was licenses on a per-processor basis
- Server 2019 Standard and Datacenter editions are licenses on a per-core basis

Client-Side Licenses

- This is for Windows 10 devices have the right to access the Servers
- Cliet Access Licenses (CALs)
  Per user or per device
- Remote Desktop Services CALs
  Per user or per device

# Install Windows Server

Windows Server 2019 Basic Requirements
- CPU: 1.4 Ghz, 64 bit processor
- RAM: 512 MB (Server Core), 2 GB (Desktop Experience)
- Disk: 32 GB free space
- Run tool msinfo32, to view system's information

Virtual Servers
- To emulate UEFI or TPM features, create a "Generation 2" virtual machine

MBR vs. GPT Partitions
- MBR (Master Boot Record)
  Works wirh BIOS, most OSs
  4 partitions max
  2TB per partition max
- GPT (GUID Partition Table)
  Works with UEFI, newer OSs
  128 partitions max
  18EB per partition max
  Booting requires 64-bit Windows

File Systems
ExFAT: external drives; cross-platform
FAT32: flash drives, older Windows drives
NTFS: Windows fixed drives, flash drives
ReFS: Windows servers, niche uses

Boot Image
- An image file (typically *.WIM) that enables a computer to start and launch
  an operating system setup program. Windows boot images run "WinPE"
- Boot images are also used for repair purposes

Install Image
- An image file (typically *.WIM) that contains an operating system for installation
- Install images may also contain applications in common use within the organization
  or a department

Answer File
- A text file containing settings that Windows Setup can use at install time
  to customize the OS installation.
- Answer files can potentially reduce the need for many separate image files

Automated Installation Options
- "Unattended" installation
  SCCM; answer files
- "Light touch" installation
  MDT; answer file

What is SCCM
- Enterprise class client/server management tool
  Hardware and software inventory
  OS and application deployment
  Update management
  Endpoint protection
  Remote control

What is MDT
- Free tool for building and deploying OS images
- Create a boot image

Network-based Deployment
- Network server running the WDS role contains images
- Client system performs "PXE" boot
- OS installs across network
- Multicasting can bring efficiencies

Migrating Users
- User-specific settings and data
  User State Migration Tools (USMT)

Migrating Server Roles
- Tools:
  Storage Migration Service
  Windows Server Migration Tools
