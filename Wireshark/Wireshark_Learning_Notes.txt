### Wireshark Learning Notes ###

# Where to capture the traffic
- Try to capture the traffic on a client as well as the server

# Wireshark Capture Options
- Go to a gear icon, to access the capture settings
- Go to Manage Interfaces, to choose only interested interfaces
- Snaplen column - how much Bytes to capture, per frame, 64 Bytes should be enough to capture header of Etherner, IP and TCP/UDP
- delta time - time in-between the packets that are displayed

# Analyzying IPv4, IPv6, and ICMP
- TTL values: 255, 128 or 64

- ICMP Types
0 - Echo reply
3 - Destination unreachable
5 - Redirect
8 - Echo request
11 - Time to live exceeded

- ICMP Code - Destination Unreachale
0 - Network unreachable (routing issue)
1 - Host unreachable (host issue)
3 - Port unreachable (host port is unavailable)
4 - Fregmentation needed

- The IPv6 Addresses
Link Local Address Range: fe80::/64
Global Address Range: 2000::/3
Unique Local Address Range fc00::/7

# Command line packet capture
- dumpcap
  -D, to list the interfaces
  -h, help menu
  -i Interface_number, to start the capture
  -w location, to specify a location for PCAP file
- Capturing via CLI is less resource intensive and it captures more RAW data

# Filtering Traffic
- Capture filter - pre-capture settings, what traffic I like to capture
  Filter syntax is way simpler than disaply filters syntax
- Display filter - post-capture settings
  To display different TCP/UDP ports: tcp.proto in {80 443 8080}
